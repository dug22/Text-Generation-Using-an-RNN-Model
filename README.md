# Introduction 
In this project I built a recurrent neural network model in Python using TensorFlow/Keras to work with a dataset of phrases for testing if it can remember long phrases. This notebook goes over the fundamenals of how Recurrent Neural Networks work, and see how it handles sequential data.

# Dataset
Our dataset consisted of an array of phrases, which served as input for training our RNN model. However, the dataset required preprocessing and modifications to make it suitable for training.

# Accuracy of Our Model
Our model achieved an accuracy of 98.75% in predicting the next set of characters to generate, demonstrating its ability to fully generate complete text from a given starting character, word, or phrase. 

# Visualization of Our Model
Our model was capable of generating the full phrase "pennies are shiny" just from the word "pen".
